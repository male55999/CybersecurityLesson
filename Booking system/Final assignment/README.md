### Reflection
During this topic, I explored the fundamentals of cybersecurity and its increasing relevance in todayâ€™s hyper-connected world. I learned about the core principles of security confidentiality, integrity, and how they apply in real scenarios. The course also covered various types of cyber threats, like phishing, malware, and social engineering. What I found particularly useful were the real world examples and case studies that highlighted how businesses and individuals are affected by cyberattacks. This topic gave me a strong foundation and context for understanding the broader goals of security in IT systems.
